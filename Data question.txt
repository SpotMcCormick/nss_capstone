Big Picture question:
 Out of the states that dont have costcos what would be the best city to open up a new costco?


Data Question:
Out of the states that dont have a Costco, find out which county of those states would be the best county to open a new warehouse based on Costco's member demographic?

From there find out what cities in those counties would be the best city to open up a new city based on Costco's member demographic?

Analyze 2 new warehouse locations (Scarborogh,ME and Hendersonville, TN) population density, population growth, & retail sales to find any benchmarks or insights that we can use to even further determine what state, county, and city to put our new Costco Warehouse?
