 # Executive Summary.
Costco Wholesale has 591 locations in 46 states (soon to be 47 state). As an employee I am curious of what goes into the decision to open a new location. Specifically, out of the states that do not have a Costco, where would be the best location to open a new one using their member demographics. Is there any correlation from the census data we can pull from with new warehouses that are opening up?
Motivation
As an employee I am genuinely curious about what goes on to decide whether to open a new Costco. This motivation came about because I currently work in a warehouse where we are the only one in the state (Ridgeland, MS). Prior to working here, I was working at Costco in Brentwood, TN. There is also a lot of buzz in the Southeast region of Costco because we are the fastest growing religion. With my experience in the company and curiosity I began to ask the question “Why aren’t there a Costco’s in these states?” Earlier this year I found out they are putting the very first Costco in Maine. My question turned into ‘why Maine?’ Every year we have a company meeting called “Perspective” where we learn the history and business side of Costco. I found out a lot of our member base demographics then I thought “Out of the states that don’t have Costco’s were would be the best place to put one based on our member demographic.” After that I knew I wanted to do my capstone one placing a new Costco where there wasn’t one. 

# Data Question

Big Picture question:
 Out of the states that dont have costcos what would be the best city to open up a new costco?Data 
Question:
Out of the states that dont have a Costco, find out which county of those states would be the best county to open a new warehouse based on Costco's member demographic?From there find out what cities in those counties would be the best city to open up a new city based on Costco's member demographic?Analyze 2 new warehouse locations (Scarborogh,ME and Hendersonville, TN) population density, population growth, & retail sales to find any benchmarks or insights that we can use to even further determine what state, county, and city to put our new Costco Warehouse?

# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

My presentation will be on PowerPoint giving any historical background and key points I would need to present for the stakeholders to fully understand the project. I would need to switch to Power BI because I will have a dashboard that breaks it down each state and demographics. For each state we are going to find the best county that matches Costco demographics. Then we are going to do the same but for the cities in those counties. Once we find the cities in each state, we will put them head to head. I’m going to build a data model in Power BI. I would also like to make hierarchies of states, counties, and cities so that we can drill down and see if a state, county, or city lines up with Costco demographics. I will conclude with my recommendation on the final city to build a new Costco Wholesale. I am envisioning the audience being a board at Costco wholesale that asked me “Where can we put a Costco where we don’t operate.”

## Known Issues and Challenges
Explain any anticipated challenges with your project, and your plan for managing them. Be sure to include:
●	Census data downloads long and not wide. I need to reformat. 
●	Lots of hierarchies to filter though and navigate. 
●	Creating the data model in Power BI so tables can relate. 
●	Multiple Tables in Power BI
●	Figure out if I can webscrape the demographic site.
