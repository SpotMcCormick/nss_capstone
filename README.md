 # Executive Summary.
Costco Wholesale has 591 locations in 46 states (soon to be 47 state). As an employee I am curious of what goes into the decision to open a new location. Specifically, out of the states that do not have a Costco, where would be the best location to open a new one using their member demographics. We will also analyze census data of 2 new store locations in Hendersonville, TN & Scarborough, ME (scheduled to open in 2023) to gain any additional insights. 

# Motivation
As an employee I am genuinely curious about what goes on to decide whether to open a new Costco. This motivation came about because I currently work in a warehouse where we are the only one in the state (Ridgeland, MS). Prior to working here, I was working at Costco in Brentwood, TN. There is also a lot of buzz in the Southeast region of Costco because we are the fastest growing region. With my experience in the company and curiosity I began to ask the question “Why aren’t there a Costco’s in these states?” Earlier this year I found out they are putting the very first Costco in Maine. My question turned into ‘why Maine?’ Every year we have a company meeting called “Perspective” where we learn the history and business side of Costco. I found out a lot of our member base demographics then I thought if I were opening up a Costco in a state that there werent any Costco's were would I put it. 

# Data Question

 Out of the states that dont have Costcos what would be the best city to open up a new Costco using member demographic data and census data? (States include WV, WY, RI)
 Analyze 2 soon to open locations and find if their are valuable insights to be gained?
 

# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
My presentation will be presented through a Tableau dashboard story. We first go through the objection of the presentation. I will give context to Costco and my motivation behind the project as well as the tools I will be using. From there I will go over Costco's demographics data, then give my insights of the counties to the 2 new store locations. We will rule out the counties that dont meet up with Costco's demographics. From there we will find the best cities in those states we will conclude which city is the best to open a costco based op member demographics.

## Known Issues and Challenges
Explain any anticipated challenges with your project, and your plan for managing them. Be sure to include:
●	Census data downloads long and not wide. I need to reformat. 
●	Lots of hierarchies to filter though and navigate. 
●	Creating the data model in Power BI so tables can relate. 
●	Multiple Tables in Power BI
●	Figure out if I can webscrape the demographic site.
